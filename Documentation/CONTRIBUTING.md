# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need contributors to help this project come to fruition. We want you working on things you're excited about.

This repository at GitHub is, where the creators and implementers of Open Standards of buildingSMART and other people work together. GitHub was usually a platform for IT oriented people. Now it is getting more and more also accessible for non-technical people. So, do not hesitate and learn the workflow. 

Here are some important resources:

  * [Information about buildingSMART](https://www.buildingsmart.org/) tells you who we are,
  * [This website](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/) is the publishing platform for our latest standards
  * Our day to day exchange and discussions are on [our Discourse](https://forums.buildingsmart.org)
  * Bugs? Yes they exist, we would like to know them, so [Github](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/issues) is where to report them
  * Features? Again Yes, we need you ideas and comments. Feel free to share them with us [here]((https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/issues))
  
## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/buildingSMART/bSDD/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include examples. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
bSI Digital Infrastructure Team and all other people that work hard to bring Open BIM to work
